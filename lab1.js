/*
  Step 1 (2.5 points):
    Create an array that contains 4 people objects.
    Each object must have at least 2 properties.
*/
console.clear();

let people = [
    {
    name: "A",
    age: "10"
  },
   {
    name: "B",
    age: "20"
  },
  {
    name: "C",
    age: "30"
  },
   {
    name: "D",
    age: "40"
  }
 
];

function listpeople(people){
    for (let i=0;i<people.length;i++){
        console.log(people[i].name)
        console.log(people[i].age)
    }
}
listpeople(people);


/*
  Step 2 (6 points):
    Create an arrow function that accepts
    a destructured object as an argument. In the body of your function, console.log a string
    template utilizing the properties you
    destructured.

}

const PrintPerson  = ({name,age})=> {
    console.log('${name,age}')
    console.log("Name:" +name, "Age:" +age)
};
PrintPerson(obj);

/*
  Step 3 (3 points):
    Loop over your array using a for/of loop.
    Call your arrow function passing the array item
    as an argument.
